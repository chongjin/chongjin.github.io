I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics at University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor [Qi Long](https://www.med.upenn.edu/long-lab/).

Before moving to Penn, I received my Ph.D. in biostatistics at UNC-Chapel Hill advised by Professors [Wei Sun](https://research.fredhutch.org/sun/en.html) and [Danyu Lin](https://dlin.web.unc.edu/) in 2020 and my B.S. in mathematics at Peking University.
