I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.njit.edu/) at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)](https://www.njit.edu/) starting from 2022.

Between 2020 and 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics at University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor [Qi Long](https://www.med.upenn.edu/long-lab/). Before moving to Penn, I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics with a minor in Computer Science at UNC-Chapel Hill advised by Professors [Wei Sun](https://research.fredhutch.org/sun/en.html) and [Danyu Lin](https://dlin.web.unc.edu/) and my B.S. in Mathematics at Peking University.
