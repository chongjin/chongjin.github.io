<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://math.njit.edu/">Department of Mathematical Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.njit.edu/">New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)</a> starting from 2022.</p>

<p>Between 2020 and 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics at University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/long-lab/">Qi Long</a>. Before moving to Penn, I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics with a minor in Computer Science at UNC-Chapel Hill advised by Professors <a href="https://research.fredhutch.org/sun/en.html">Wei Sun</a> and <a href="https://dlin.web.unc.edu/">Danyu Lin</a> and my B.S. in Mathematics at Peking University.</p>
